##### -<ins>Abstract</ins>: Many colleges have invested in writing centers to lead institutional efforts to improve student writing across their curriculum. These writing centers often offer one-on-one consultation services in which students receive specialized coaching from trained staff on upcoming writing assignments. However, there are currently few studies in writing pedagogy literature that quantify the effect of these consultation services on future academic performance. In this study, we matched 1000 students who visited the West Point Writing Center from January - December 2019 for appointments with trained staff members before a writing assignment to controls in the student body. We used statistical methods rooted in causal inference (propensity score matching) to select controls with similar demographics, experience, and academic ability. We found a statistically significant improvement in student performance on the writing assignment following multiple visits to the writing center after adjusting for the student characteristics mentioned above. Ultimately, these findings suggest that wider access to consultation services may be beneficial to developing undergraduate writing.
