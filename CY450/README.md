# CY450: Cyber Security Engineering

##### -<ins>Course Description</ins>: The focus for this course is to design, build and test secure networked computer systems. Topics covered include operating system and network security, secure network architecture, and offensive and defensive information operations. Practical exercises that give students hands-on experience with current network security tools and techniques complement a series of laboratory exercises that have small groups of cadets secure their own small network. In a culminating exercise, cadets design, build and test defensive measures to protect a production network from intrusions.
##### -<ins>Project</ins>: To successfully complete the assignment, students will apply concepts from previous coursework in CY300, CY350, and CY450. Each student group represents an information technology (IT) response team called in to replace the IT department for a company in one of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors. We will simply refer to this company as the sector to which it belongs. Groups will design and build an improved network for their sector according to these network specifications.  Student groups will then integrate, update, and secure the existing hosts and servers while maintaining prior functionality. The culiminating exercise will require student groups to identify a network breach and successfully re-establish proper network functionality.
